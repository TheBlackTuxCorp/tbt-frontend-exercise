## Stack
- `Express` server to server the app
- `Webpack` to bundle the client code
- `React` & `Redux` on the front end

- `jest` for unit testing
- `eslint` for linting the code

## Running

- `npm test` to run any tests and eslint

## More Info
React and Redux are initialized in `src/client/app/index.js`. You'll probably want to start coding in `src/client/app/pages/home/index.js`.
